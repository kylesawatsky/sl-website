You&#8217;ve probably seen themes marketed as &#8220;the last WordPress theme you&#8217;ll ever need.&#8221; They kinds of themes purport to have so much flexibility that they can be suitable for any kind of website. Stargazer was launched as the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Justin Tadlock is aiming to restore the original design for the relationship between parent and child themes. His post on <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/designing-the-box" target="_blank">Designing in a Box</a> further explains the philosophy behind child themes with limitations where the parent theme houses the majority of the design. The Stargazer experiment inspired a flurry of child themes. It represented a shift in how Theme Hybrid themes are built and its overwhelming success prompted Tadlock to create another.</p>
<p><a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/saga-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Saga</a> is the next parent theme in Theme Hybrid&#8217;s revolution. It was designed specifically for writers and has been stripped of anything that would distract from the content.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/saga.png" rel="prettyphoto[29076]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/saga.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="saga" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29607" /></a></p>
<p>The theme was designed with careful attention to typography, since it focuses on the written word. The homepage and single posts display big, bold featured images. The customizer offers custom color options and a header icon option with 400+ icons to choose from. Navigation is mobile-friendly and hidden until clicked.</p>
<p>Saga seamlessly integrates with several of Tadlock&#8217;s free plugins for further customization, including <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-background-extended" target="_blank">Custom Background Extended</a>, <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/grid-columns" target="_blank">Grid Columns</a>, and <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-header-extended" target="_blank">Custom Header Extended</a> for per-post headers and backgrounds.</p>
<p>The theme is compatible with Philip Author Moore‚Äôs new <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-subtitles-to-wordpress-posts-pages-and-custom-post-types" target="_blank">Subtitles</a> plugin, which offers an elegant and portable way to include subtitles even if you change themes.</p>
<p>Saga also includes beautiful support for post formats with a unique design for each format.</p>

<h3>Build a Saga Child Theme</h3>
<p>If you want to build a child theme for Saga, the barrier for entry is intentionally low so that new theme developers can easily get started experimenting. &#8220;Like Stargazer, you can literally build a custom child theme for Saga with just a few lines of code,&#8221; Tadlock said. Child theme authors who submit their themes to Theme Hybrid and WordPress.org will receive a free, lifetime membership to Theme Hybrid. You&#8217;ll also receive a detailed technical review from Tadlock and the WordPress Theme Review Team, which will help you refine your skills as a theme author.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not planning on building a child theme, Saga is beautiful without any modifications. It offers writers a unique design for sharing stories while keeping the focus on the content. If your blog needs a design refresh, you can <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/saga" target="_blank">download Saga</a> for free from Theme Hybrid. It will also be arriving soon on WordPress.org, pending approval.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Sep 2014 18:32:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Version 3.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Boilerplate</a> was released today. The open source project was started in 2011 by Tom McFarlin as a GitHub repository for storing code while he learned plugin development. Over the past three years, the boilerplate has matured beyond his expectations with the help of 39 contributors. It now has more than 1800 stars on GitHub and a brand new logo and <a href="http://wppb.io/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New in 3.0?</h3>
<p>The 3.0 release constitutes a major rewrite of the boilerplate. The primary objective of the project is to provide a standardized, object-oriented starting place for building high quality plugins.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the new version, we&#8217;ve broken things down into a very, very specific organizational structure,&#8221; McFarlin explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more object-oriented than it&#8217;s predecessor, the code doesn&#8217;t include a lot of TODO&#8217;s. Instead, the comments give developers guidance as to what a variable or a function should be doing when using the Boilerplate.&#8221;</p>
<p>As developers implement their own work using the boilerplate, they are encouraged to overwrite the comments that are included as a guide.</p>
<p>McFarlin and contributors made every effort to ensure that the code in version 3.0 conforms to WordPress&#8217; <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards" target="_blank">coding standards</a> and its <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Inline_Documentation" target="_blank">inline documentation standards</a>.</p>
<p>The plugin boilerplate now includes classes that are responsible for everything. There are classes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin activation</li>
<li>Plugin deactivation</li>
<li>Plugin Internationalization</li>
<li>A class that&#8217;s used to register all hooks with WordPress</li>
<li>A core plugin class</li>
<li>Some use of common object-oriented design paradigms</li>
<li>A specific location for dashboard-related functionality, styles, and scripts</li>
<li>A location for public-facing styles, and scripts</li>
<li>A location for shared code (be it libraries or not)</li>
<li>A template for a plugin readme</li>
<li>A directory structure that mimics the WordPress Plugin Repository&#8217;s Subversion directory</li>
<li>Places for screenshots, banner images, and even the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-adds-custom-icons-to-the-plugin-installer" target="_blank">custom icons</a> that were just announced for WordPress 4.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The new directory structure is now broken down into assets and trunk directories:</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wppb-directory-structure.png" rel="prettyphoto[29559]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wppb-directory-structure.png?resize=884%2C620" alt="wppb-directory-structure" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29580" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most exciting updates to 3.0 is that this version of the boilerplate can be installed and activated like a regular plugin, making it easier for new plugin developers to get started. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t introduce any functionality into WordPress,&#8221; McFarlin explained. &#8220;But there are two sample JavaScript files that show how to use the core Boilerplate code to get started.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Future of the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate: Expanded Documentation and Community</h3>
<p>Version 3.0 omits the <a href="https://github.com/afragen/github-updater" target="_blank">Github Updater</a>, which was part of previous versions. The reason behind this change is that McFarlin wanted to scale back the boilerplate&#8217;s contents in order to offer only the bare essentials to get started.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I want to start up Editions (or basically forks) of the Boilerplate that are tailored to those who like to use Grunt or Composer or those who want to include the GitHub updater in the plugin,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m a big fan of it and I use it in a number of my plugins, but I didn&#8217;t want to build it into this version when it can just as easily be added by someone else&#8217;s fork.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new website and branding in place, McFarlin hopes to develop the community behind the project. &#8220;Hopefully, having a face to relate to the Boilerplate will help elevate it beyond just a miscellaneous GitHub repository,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A domain, a logo, branding, and all of that stuff can go a long way in helping others to associate a project with an idea and a group of people more than an open source repository and a README could ever do.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFarlin plans to expand the boilerplate&#8217;s documentation on the website and grow a community where developers can share ideas and forks that they&#8217;ve created for specific use cases, such as WordPress multisite.</p>
<p>Appealing to new developers is also part of the goal for the new website. <strong>&#8220;I want to make the Boilerplate more accessible &#8211; GitHub is great, but it&#8217;s great if you&#8217;re a programmer,&#8221;<strong> McFarlin said. &#8220;If not, it&#8217;s really intimidating and people have no idea how to get started with contributing to a project.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boilerplate website will serve to provide documentation, example code, and an explanation of how people can get involved contributing to the project. McFarlin is even considering adding courses, editions, and a forum. &#8220;To be honest, I&#8217;ve even considered holding online events where people can pay to learn how to use the Boilerplate for certain things, though this and all of the other things are so far on the backburner that it&#8217;s hard to envision how it&#8217;s going to play out right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Over the years, the community surrounding the boilerplate has helped to shape its future and McFarlin is committed to move the project in a direction that continues to serve WordPress plugin developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the one thing that I never expect to hear, yet never get tired of hearing, is: <em>&#8216;I didn&#8217;t know how to write a plugin or where to start until I found the Boilerplate,&#8217;</em>&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a really great feeling.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Sep 2014 14:41:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><em>This post is part of a monthly series summarizing some stats and figures from the Akismet universe. Feel free to browse <a href="http://blog.akismet.com/category/monthly-roundup/">all of the posts in the series</a>.</em></p>
<p>In August, there were 7,203,785,500 pieces of spam that came through Akismet. <strong>If each piece of spam were one word, it would take 6645 copies of the Harry Potter series to accomodate them all.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the number of spam and legitimate comments (what we call ham) we saw last month:</p>
<div id="attachment_1682" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-aug-2014.png"><img class="wp-image-1682 size-large" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/akismet-spam-and-ham-stats-aug-2014.png?w=700&h=436" alt="Akismet spam and ham stats Aug 2014" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our busiest day was August 21, with about 269 million spam messages, and the slowest day was August 3 with 173 million. We missed only about 1 in every 5,916 spams.</p></div>
<p>The number of spam message is up 92% from last year, which is a similar large rise we&#8217;ve seen in previous months. It&#8217;s also up from last month by 28%.</p>
<p>The number of legimate messages that went through this month is 33,377,8500. <strong>If¬†each legitimate comment was a word, they&#8217;d only fill 307 copies of the Harry Potter series.</strong> The amount¬†of legitimate content going around is only about 4% &#8211; and the large difference is business as usual.</p>
<p>As always, if your own missed spam or false positive numbers are on the rise, we&#8217;d love to help. You can reach out through our <a href="http://akismet.com/contact/">contact form</a>.</p>
<p>August was a big month in the spam universe, three services were in the news. Google added new spam filtering support to Gmail &#8211; you can find more info on <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2464440/google-tightens-gmail-spam-filtering.html">PC World</a>. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/fighting-spam-with-botmaker">announced</a> its new spam filtering system, BotMaker. And, Apple&#8217;s iMessage seems to have been hit with a bout of spam. Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/apples-imessage-is-being-taken-over-by-spammers/">explained why</a>, though MacWorld showed us why the numbers <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2597429/hold-the-phone-imessage-spam-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be.html">may not in fact be so dire</a>.</p>

<p>Tickets are <a title="http://podscamp.org/tickets/" href="http://podscamp.org/tickets/">now on sale</a> for the first ever <a title="http://podscamp.org/" href="http://podscamp.org/">PodsCamp</a>. It&#8217;s being held in Dallas, TX on October 3rd, 2014, a day before <a title="http://2014.dfw.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.dfw.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp DFW</a> (Dallas/Fort Worth) with a ticket price of $50 each. Each ticket grants you access to the event, BBQ for lunch, and direct access to the developers of Pods Framework.</p>
<p>The event will focus on what you can do with Pods and will <a title="http://podscamp.org/schedule/" href="http://podscamp.org/schedule/">feature sessions on topics</a> such as an introduction to Pods, building applications, and a Q&amp;A session with the Pods development team. For those not familiar with the plugin, <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods</a> is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields.</p>
<h2>A First For The Pods Development Team</h2>
<p>The event will mark the first time the entire Pods development team will be under one roof. Lead developer for Pods, Scott Kingsley Clark, said the team will be in Dallas, TX the Wednesday before WordCamp and will be working on putting the finishing touches on Pods 3.0.</p>
<p>Clark explains why the team hasn&#8217;t had a PodsCamp in the past. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking about and planning an event like this for years, but it wasn&#8217;t until the Pods team grew large enough for me to feel like we could really do something worth people&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>No Conflicts With WordCamp</h2>
<p>Initially, I thought PodsCamp was taking place at the same time as WordCamp DFW but since it&#8217;s a day before, it won&#8217;t interfere with the event. &#8220;It&#8217;s completely separate, in terms of organization and funding,&#8221; Clark told the Tavern.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a title="http://podcamp.pbworks.com/w/page/17344268/FrontPage" href="http://podcamp.pbworks.com/w/page/17344268/FrontPage">PodCamps</a> would sometimes be merged with a WordCamp to offer attendees a chance to attend two events with one ticket. However, WordCamp central frowns against this practice and now states that WordCamps must be focused on WordPress. From the WordCamp Central FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q.</strong> Can I do a track at a BarCamp/PodCamp/other event and call it WordCamp?<br />
<strong>A.</strong> No. The use of the WordCamp name indicates that it is a standalone event dedicated to WordPress, and to prevent confusion, WordPress ‚Äútracks‚Äù within larger events such as BarCamp or other conferences are no longer called WordCamps.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Sponsoring and Needing to Be Sponsored</h2>
<p>The <a title="http://podsfoundation.org/" href="http://podsfoundation.org/">Pods Foundation</a> is sponsoring the WordCamp DFW Contributor Day on October 5th, through a deal Clark made to secure the same space for both days.¬†At the same time, PodsCamp is in need of more sponsors. If you&#8217;re interested in <a title="http://podscamp.org/2014/08/19/call-sponsors/" href="http://podscamp.org/2014/08/19/call-sponsors/">sponsorship opportunities</a>, please get in touch with the organizing team. SiteGround, Chris Lema, Aesop Interactive, and Beil Media are just a sample of the sponsors already on board with helping the event.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great to see events like PodsCamp where you can focus on a particular plugin or subject while not conflicting with a WordCamp that same weekend. I like the strategy on the part of Clark and his team for the event to be a day before WordCamp so people can attend both without worrying about missing sessions.</p>

Clients are attracted to WordPress because of how easy it is to manage content. In the old days, if you had a website built, you would still need to hire a developer to make updates to your content or design. WordPress makes it possible for anyone to create new posts, pages, products, etc., without any technical experience.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is that your design may be in danger when everything is so easy to edit. If you want to keep branding consistent across a website, you may need to include a style guide to breakdown the design you&#8217;ve created.</p>
<p>Having a style guide for reference is especially important if you are passing off a CMS to a client who will be using it to create content on a regular basis. Without a guide your client may go nuts with customization features that may be built into the theme. Before you know it, he will have used 10 different typefaces in various places and multiple header colors and sizes. The beautiful website you created can end up looking like digital goulash in the end, which is no good for your portfolio.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to introduce you to <a href="http://stylifyme.com/" target="_blank">Stylify Me</a>, a handy new tool that can automatically create a quick style guide for any website. Simply enter the site URL and the app will return its background colors, text colors, typography, and image dimensions.</p>
<p>Here are the colors you get when you input WordPress.org:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-styles.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29499]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-styles.jpg?resize=982%2C552" alt="wordpress-styles" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29504" /></a></p>
<p>It also returns the typography and image dimensions found on the homeapage.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-typography.png" rel="prettyphoto[29499]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wordpress-typography.png?resize=973%2C491" alt="wordpress-typography" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29517" /></a></p>
<p>The download for your style guide comes in the form of a PDF, a somewhat inconvenient file type that many clients seem to love for whatever reason. Obviously, this is just a quick start which you can further edit and fine tune. Some homepages may not lend themselves as well to demonstrating the site&#8217;s style. In that case you may want to select another content page from which the app can extract styles more representative of the site as a whole.</p>
<p>The Stylify Me app was built on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and <a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank">PhantomJS</a>. Its creators, <a href="https://twitter.com/annabelleyoon" target="_blank">Annabelle Yoon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MicMro" target="_blank">Michael Mrowetz</a>, wanted to provide a tool that would allow designers to research sites more efficiently, without having to inspect each element. The app is hosted on <a href="http://heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi" target="_blank">multi buildpack</a> and is MIT-licensed. Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/micmro/Stylify-Me" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to see how it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://stylifyme.com" target="_blank">Stylify Me</a> gives you the ability to quickly generate a style guide that will help your clients keep their websites within the realm of the original design. Providing a style guide adds an extra touch, which demonstrates that you care and are invested in your client&#8217;s success.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 22:23:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

As client work became more frustrating, he decided to focus his attention on WordPress themes. After an unsuccessful attempt to monetize themes at Creative Market, Bosire decided to try his hand at developing themes for WordPress.org. <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/nouveau-riche" target="_blank">Nouveau Riche</a> was approved this week and is his first theme in the directory.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nouveau-riche.png" rel="prettyphoto[29473]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nouveau-riche.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="nouveau-riche" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29483" /></a></p>
<p>Nouveau Riche is a simple, customizable blogging theme that was designed for creative minds. It offers beautiful support for post formats, with custom icons assigned to each. The theme utilizes the native WordPress customizer to include options for uploading a logo, adding a header and background image, and setting colors for the header, background, and theme.</p>
<p>The sidebar is hidden by default and slides out when clicked. The theme also includes support for two other widget areas- main footer and sub footer.</p>

<p>Check out a <a href="http://demo.fortisthemes.com/nouveau/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see the theme in action.</p>
<p>Nouveau Riche is based on the <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a> starter theme. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use any framework, just _S starter theme, which I use for ALL of my other themes,&#8221; Bosire told the Tavern. &#8220;No CSS framework either; I find them very unsuitable for WordPress themes because of all the bloat. Took me about three days from start to finish and submitted it immediately,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bosire found that building the theme was easy and quick, because he was used to all the WordPress coding standards after finishing a theme for WordPress.com. His commercial theme is currently undergoing review and should be launching in a few days. He plans to release another free theme in September in addition to another commercial blogging theme that is still in process.</p>
<p>His journey began when he started offering free themes on his website. &#8220;I started building simple blogging themes and offering them for free on my website,&#8221; Bosire said. &#8220;I then proceeded to build premium themes that I sell on Creative Market. Sadly, they didn&#8217;t sell as expected but I really enjoyed building themes, so I decided to continue doing it, this time for WordPress.org.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bosire&#8217;s tenacity in continuing theme development after a discouraging experience is admirable. If you build a theme and submit it to one marketplace where it doesn&#8217;t take off, don&#8217;t get discouraged and stop building themes. If you love creating themes for WordPress users, try again via a different distribution route. If you choose to go the WordPress.org route, you&#8217;ll learn quite a bit during the process with the help of <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-wordpress-theme-reviewer" target="_blank">Theme Review Team</a>.</p>
<p>Nouveau Riche is a beautiful and simple blogging theme that you can personalize in a matter of minutes. It&#8217;s responsive and translation-ready. If your blog needs a fresh design but you don&#8217;t have a lot of time, this might be good option. <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/nouveau-riche" target="_blank">Download </a> Nouveau Riche for free from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 20:43:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

It&#8217;s called <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-delete" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-delete">Bulk Delete</a> and is developed by Sudar Muthu, a developer based in Bangalore, India. The changelog not only shows which bugs have been fixed or features that were added, it also displays the amount of time spent on each release.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BulkDeleteChangelog.png" rel="prettyphoto[29275]"><img class="size-full wp-image-29472" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BulkDeleteChangelog.png?resize=524%2C462" alt="Bulk Delete Changelog On WordPress.org" /></a>Bulk Delete Changelog On WordPress.org
<p>Due to some personal things going in his life, Muthu began to track how much time he was investing in his side projects. &#8220;This happened because I got married and suddenly the amount of free time that I used to have in my life started to dry up. I wanted to find out which pet projects are taking up the majority of my free time,&#8221; Muthu Told the Tavern. In April of 2012, <a title="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/started-tracking-time-spend-on-my-pet-projects/" href="http://sudarmuthu.com/blog/started-tracking-time-spend-on-my-pet-projects/">he wrote about the initiative</a> and started adding the metrics to the changelog of Bulk Delete.</p>

<p>Some plugin authors have funded development of their plugin by having users pay for specific features. Muthu doesn&#8217;t get paid to work on Bulk Delete but he has started to sell <a title="http://bulkwp.com/" href="http://bulkwp.com/">commercial addons</a> for it.</p>
<h2>A Different Approach to Getting Free Support</h2>
<p>One of the things Muthu has noticed is how users approach him to receive free support. &#8220;After I started adding the amount of time I am spending on different plugins in the changelog, the way people interact in the support forum seems to have changed a bit. I felt that they were able to understand the amount of time I am investing in developing and supporting a free plugin,&#8221; Muthu said.</p>
<p>I asked if he thinks this is something other plugin authors should consider implementing. &#8220;Each developer has their own preference but I guess if possible, I would like plugin authors to do this. It seems <a title="https://twitter.com/kelter/status/478983307884236801" href="https://twitter.com/kelter/status/478983307884236801">people like it</a> and it will also let people know how much time an author spends in developing and maintaining a free plugin,&#8221; Muthu said.</p>
<h2>I Think It&#8217;s a Great Idea</h2>
<p>As someone who investigates the changelog for every plugin update, I&#8217;ve seen my share of them. However, I&#8217;ve yet to see one that is as detailed and informative as <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-delete/changelog/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-delete/changelog/">Bulk Delete</a>. Showing the amount of time each version takes to develop gives users a perspective of the time and effort required to maintain a plugin. We generally hear how much time is involved, but rarely get to see how much.</p>
<p>Would you like to see this type of information added to the changelog of more plugins? Will seeing the amount of time change the way you approach the author to receive support? Sound off in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 19:56:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve gotten lots of useful feedback from all kinds of webmasters and users, and we&#8217;ve tweaked, updated, and honed recognition and displaying of authorship information. Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve also observed that this information isn‚Äôt as useful to our users as we‚Äôd hoped, and can even distract from those results. With this in mind, we&#8217;ve made the difficult decision to stop showing authorship in search results.</p></blockquote>
<p>In June 2014, author photos were <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-plays-authorship-search-results-dropping-profile-image-google-circle-count-195163" target="_blank">dropped from search results</a> in order to reduce clutter in the design, according to Mueller. Today&#8217;s announcement means that the rel=author markup will no longer be tracked on websites.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cutts.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29438]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cutts.jpg?resize=472%2C280" alt="Google authorship in action" class="size-full wp-image-9315" /></a>Google authorship in action
<p>Authorship was an experiment that Google had been running for the past three years. Mueller reported that their tests showed that removing authorship generally does not seem to reduce traffic to sites, nor does it make it more likely that users will click on ads. The change was allegedly implemented to improve users&#8217; experience.</p>
<p>Although the authorship schema is no longer used to identify a post&#8217;s author in search results, Mueller says there&#8217;s no need to be in a rush to remove it from your code. &#8220;We&#8217;re no longer using it for authorship, we treat it like any other markup on your pages. Leaving it is fine, it won&#8217;t cause problems (and perhaps your users appreciate being able to find out more about you through your profile too),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jetpack 2.5 introduced an easy way for WordPress users to <a href="http://wptavern.com/automatically-add-google-authorship-to-wordpress-posts-with-jetpack-2-5" target="_blank">add authorship to posts</a>. Representatives from the Jetpack team were not immediately available to comment on whether or not the plugin will shed the dead weight of authorship in the next release. There are many other WordPress <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=google+authorship" target="_blank">plugins that add Google authorship</a>, though not as elegantly as Jetpack did. Several major SEO plugins also incorporate ways to add authorship to posts. The authorship-related functionality in these plugins is now obsolete.</p>
<p>Mueller emphasized that even though authorship is being discontinued, Google will continue its support for structured markup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Going forward, we&#8217;re strongly committed to continuing and expanding our support of structured markup (such as <a href="http://schema.org/" target="_blank">schema.org</a>). This markup helps all search engines better understand the content and context of pages on the web, and we&#8217;ll continue to use it to show rich snippets in search results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many SEO specialists have speculated that linking authorship to Google+ profiles was a ploy to get more people to use Google+, a product that has failed to gain momentum. Fans of the authorship feature are baffled by its removal, given that Google&#8217;s research indicates that it doesn&#8217;t seem to affect search results. From a user&#8217;s standpoint, seeing an author you recognize can be tremendously beneficial when selecting among similar search results.</p>
<p>Google is well known for experimenting with features and products and killing them off as soon as tests show that they are no longer valuable. It&#8217;s not clear whether or not authorship will be reincarnated in some other form down the road. If you&#8217;re using a WordPress plugin that adds authorship to your site for SEO purposes, you are safe to disable it, as Google is no longer interested in that data.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 01:25:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Earlier this year we featured the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProWordPress/" target="_blank">/r/ProWordPress </a> subreddit on a post exploring various <a href="http://wptavern.com/add-these-subreddits-to-your-list-of-wordpress-watering-holes" target="_blank">WordPress watering holes</a>. If you&#8217;re not familiar with subreddits, they are essentially focused topics where where registered users can vote article submissions &#8220;up&#8221; or &#8220;down.&#8221; Subscribing to a subreddit allows you to hone in on specific topics where you have an interest.</p>
<p>/r/ProWordPress was started by Brad Williams, CEO of <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/" target="_blank">WebDevStudios</a> and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>. As a developer, Williams has a strong interest in exploring more technical topics surrounding WordPress. The group recently passed 1,000 subscribers (currently at 1,027 readers) and continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/prowordpress-subreddit.png" rel="prettyphoto[29393]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/prowordpress-subreddit.png?resize=743%2C309" alt="prowordpress-subreddit" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29421" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I started the r/ProWordPress subreddit to focus on more advanced WordPress topics,&#8221; Williams told the Tavern.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress" target="_blank">r/WordPress</a> is great but will always have more beginner users, so it&#8217;s hard for the more advanced topics to surface. <strong>r/ProWordPress is a smaller, more focused subreddit with a focus on advanced WP topics.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>As the subreddit has grown, r/ProWordPress has become one of William&#8217;s main sources of news on WordPress development. More subscribers translates into a wider reach of advanced topics as well as more voting users to curate the quality of articles that float to the top. Williams has the ability to moderate the topics submitted but reports that, unless you have a highly active subreddit, very little work is required.</p>
<p>With WordPress now powering <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">more than 23% of all websites online</a>, the community surrounding the software is growing at breakneck speed. People are working with WordPress every day, building businesses on top of it, and are seeking out places online to learn from each other. Matt Mullenweg recently jumped in on the <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-hosts-impromptu-qa-session-on-facebook" target="_blank">Advanced WordPress group on Facebook</a>, which has accrued more than 9,000 members. This group explores a wide range of WordPress-related topics but may not appeal to everyone.</p>
<p>While some WordPress users enjoy interacting on Facebook, others are taking to forums such as <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpchat-relaunches-as-a-forum-dedicated-to-wordpress" target="_blank">WP Chat</a>. Different kinds of groups are popping up, reflecting the various interaction styles that WordPress community members use to connect.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;WordPress has such a large user base that it&#8217;s hard to have a one size fits all area for all topics,&#8221;</strong> Williams said. In his corner of the internet, he hopes that /r/ProWordPress will continue to be a nice place to share and read about more advanced topics. In some ways Reddit combines the best aspects of both Twitter and forums, in that you can share articles, vote, and comment to enter into discussions with other members. If advanced WordPress development falls within your wheelhouse, make sure to drop by the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProWordPress/" target="_blank">/r/ProWordPress </a> subreddit and subscribe to new topics.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 23:15:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Yesterday we featured a plugin, created by application developer Jeroen Sormani, that <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-dashboard-notes-clones-google-keep-in-the-wordpress-dashboard" target="_blank">clones Google Keep functionality in the WordPress dashboard</a>. Sormani has produced a number of other interesting experiment with WordPress, including a little known tool for generating WordPress settings.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wpsettingsapi.jeroensormani.com/" target="_blank">WP Settings Generator</a> is a tool for plugin and theme developers. It generates a custom options page that is fully compatible with the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API" target="_blank">WordPress Settings API</a> standards. The tool is similar to the kinds of generators found at <a href="http://generatewp.com/" target="_blank">GenerateWP</a>, which lacks a tool for creating settings.</p>
<p>On the config tab you can enter your plugin/theme name, plugin prefix, and text domain. Select your menu position and then proceed to the next tab.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/settings-generator.png" rel="prettyphoto[29385]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/settings-generator.png?resize=730%2C417" alt="settings-generator" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29387" /></a></p>
<p>The next screen provides a drag-and-drop interface for adding settings fields:</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/settings-fields.png" rel="prettyphoto[29385]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/settings-fields.png?resize=974%2C662" alt="settings-fields" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29388" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have added all your fields, you will be presented with your customized settings code, which you can scroll through and copy to your plugin. Although it is designed to create settings pages for themes or plugins, the general consensus these days is that it&#8217;s preferable to utilize the native customizer for theme settings.</p>

<p>After reviewing your code, you have the opportunity to leave a personalized review of the generator. If you find that the code you receive has any errors or seems off, make sure to let Sormani know with a quick comment.</p>
<p>Of course, using a settings generator isn&#8217;t going to help you learn how the WordPress Settings API works, but it does give you a quick start for creating options. It&#8217;s not so much of a teaching tool but rather designed to eliminate the rote task of writing your own settings. <a href="http://wpsettingsapi.jeroensormani.com/" target="_blank">Check it out</a> and let us know if it ends up saving you time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 21:03:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The plugin is simple to use and configure. After it&#8217;s installed and activated, you&#8217;ll find the settings in <strong>Settings &gt; Comment Approved</strong>. It&#8217;s important to note that even when the plugin is activated, it won&#8217;t send out notifications unless you check mark the box to enable the comment approved message.</p>

<p>The text area is populated with a default message using the only two shortcodes available. You can customize this message using standard HTML. Here is what the default message looks like in an email.</p>

<p>While I like the default behavior to notify users when their comment is approved, you can use this plugin to award first time commenters. For example, you can send them a link to a free eBook or a different promotional item. Once the user&#8217;s comment is approved, they won&#8217;t see the approval message again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strange that comment approval notifications are not part of the default behaviour of WordPress. I think it makes sense, especially if the front-end notifies them that their comment may be held in moderation. While I doubt this plugin will prevent commenters from getting in touch with site administrators to figure out why their comment is not displaying on the site, at least they&#8217;ll know when it&#8217;s approved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:49:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Jason Schuller who was the previous owner of <a title="http://press75.com/" href="http://press75.com/">Press75.com</a>, has <a title="https://medium.com/@jschuller/a-brief-history-of-a-wordpress-theme-business-3847e16fcba4" href="https://medium.com/@jschuller/a-brief-history-of-a-wordpress-theme-business-3847e16fcba4">published a great post</a> detailing his experience of running a WordPress commercial theme business from 2008-2014. While Schuller describes a variety of ups and downs he encountered while running the business, I thought his reasoning for losing his way in 2010 was fascinating.</p>
<blockquote><p>As WordPress became increasingly more complex and option rich, so did the demand for themes. The proverbial ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù of the WordPress world hit and new shops were launching almost weekly with themes that were powered by complex frameworks including endless layout, customization, style options and ‚Äúshortcodes‚Äù. In 2010 I began to focus more on the ‚Äúbar‚Äù that had been set by the market and less on why I started Press75 to begin with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of continuing to focus on what he was so good at doing, he started developing themes to cater to the market which was outside of his passion. The increase in complexity in WordPress coupled with various development techniques he implemented in his catalog of 20 themes became a huge burden, especially when it came to support. One piece of advice Schuller shares that I think is important and hits home for many commercial theme authors is to¬†<span class="pullquote alignleft">never forget who you are and what your own style is. Be inspired by what others are doing, but always stay true to yourself.</span></p>
<p>Schuller is not the first person to learn this lesson the hard way. When <a title="https://upthemes.com/open-letter/" href="https://upthemes.com/open-letter/">UpThemes announced</a> a complete restructuring of their theme business in early 2014, they cited poor infrastructure as one of the main culprits of creating a large demand for support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Building the themes was easy enough, but then selling, deploying, supporting, updating, and generally making a profit on them was something we struggled with, mightily. With every theme, we introduced a ton of new code that had to be supported and maintained. This was at a time when WordPress was still changing the way themes worked. It made development more difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the things Schuller wished he had done is to hire the right people once the business became too much to handle. Not doing so put all of the pressure of running the business on his shoulders. In the post, he shares a few other lessons I think aspiring theme shop owners can learn from as well. If you&#8217;d like to hear Schuller tell his story, listen to this <a title="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-jason-schuller-founder-of-press75-com" href="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-jason-schuller-founder-of-press75-com">special interview</a> I did with him early in 2014.</p>

<p>Dashboard notes can come in handy when working with multiple people on a WordPress site. Even when working alone, you can use notes to collect ideas for posts or to remind yourself of important publishing-related tasks and ways to promote your posts. While there are many varying plugins devoted to creating sticky notes in the dashboard, the new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dashboard-notes/" target="_blank">WP Dashboard Notes</a> plugin stands out with an interesting implementation that mirrors Google&#8217;s popular note-taking service.</p>
<p>Google junkies will notice that the color scheme of the notes is strangely similar to that of Google Keep, if not identical. The note creation and management process is also very similar in that there is no save button for editing and everything is saved automatically in the background.</p>
<p>WP Dashboard Notes doesn&#8217;t add any admin menus. Once installed, you can create a new note by clicking &#8220;Add Note&#8221; under Screen Options in the upper right corner. After you create your first note, you can add new notes from the black bar within existing notes.</p>

<p>A new note pops into your dashboard, which you can now edit and skin with one of the preset colors. Like Google Keep, notes can be set as a single note or a list. Users also have the option to set the visibility to &#8216;Everyone&#8217; or &#8216;Private.&#8217; Here&#8217;s a quick demo:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wp-dashboard-notes.gif" rel="prettyphoto[29322]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wp-dashboard-notes.gif?resize=578%2C473" alt="wp-dashboard-notes" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29333" /></a></p>
<p>WP Dashboard Notes contains virtually all the same capabilities of Google Keep, minus the ability to upload images. The plugin&#8217;s features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colored notes</li>
<li>List notes or regular notes</li>
<li>Public or private notes</li>
<li>Edit on dashboard</li>
<li>Add as many notes as you like</li>
<li>Drag and drop list items</li>
<li>No save button needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple notes arranged together create a colorful dashboard full of ideas and users will see public notes upon logging in.</p>

<p>After testing the plugin I found that it was simple and intuitive to use. The plugin, created by application developer <a href="http://www.jeroensormani.com/" target="_blank">Jeroen Sormani</a>, elegantly merges WordPress and Google Keep functionality to create a useful addition to the dashboard.</p>
<p>You can customize the colors by overriding the plugin&#8217;s CSS from another stylesheet. Additional color palettes and per-user visibility settings might make the plugin even more fun, but for now Sormani has kept it delightfully simple.</p>
<p>If you need note-taking capabilities for better collaboration in the dashboard, this plugin works as advertised and goes far beyond most other dashboard notes plugins. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dashboard-notes/" target="_blank">WP Dashboard Notes</a> is available for free from WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 22:41:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Once the gates were opened, the questions started pouring in. Here are a few of my favorites along with Mullenweg&#8217;s answers.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most important thing we can do to support and bring value to WordPress?</strong></p>
<p><em>Everyone really sets their own path. Think about the thing that makes you happiest, what you consider your gift that you can share with the world, or something that you want to learn a lot more about.</em></p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the businesses and entire industries that are built around WordPress and what opportunities do you see in the future?</strong></p>
<p><em>I think it&#8217;s awesome there are whole industries built on WordPress, that was part of the idea from very early on. It&#8217;s counter-intuitive, but I actually think one of bigger opportunities is in consulting and building sites right now. WordPress can get people 90% of the way there, but that last 10% represents a lot of opportunity for clients from the Fortune 500 to the smallest personal sites.</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m curious about Automattic&#8217;s policy about unlimited vacation days. I have never heard of this policy anywhere else. How does that play out? Seems like such an awesome place to work.</strong></p>
<p><em>I think open vacation policies are becoming more common, here&#8217;s an article that covers the pros and cons fairly well and says 1% of companies offer them now: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pros-and-cons-of-unlimited-vacation-2013-12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Pros And Cons Of Unlimited Vacation Policies</a></em></p>
<p><em>I think it really comes down to hiring. With the right people you can have very liberal policies like this because people think about the organization as a whole and do the right thing. If anything we sometimes have to encourage people to take a bit more time off, something I don&#8217;t always set the best example of but I&#8217;m trying this week. I&#8217;ll be completely offline Thursday through Sunday.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is the Codex really going to disappear eventually?</strong></p>
<p><em>We&#8217;re not going to take down the Codex until we have something better to replace it. It&#8217;s more likely you&#8217;ll just see more links default to someplace new and Codex traffic will trail off until at some point, we&#8217;ll put it into archive mode.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you think now that JSON support in WordPress core is coming, should it be used over RSS for building things like Mobile Apps? What you would recommend?</strong></p>
<p><em>Whether you use the prototype JSON API or RSS for a mobile app I would say depends a lot on what it does. Think of the JSON API more as replacing XML-RPC.</em></p>
<p><em>What would be great for everyone is to start to try and build applications on top of the prototype API, and let the team know where you get stuck or find things hard to understand. I&#8217;m extremely anxious to have a cleaner API in core, but I feel strongly that it should remain a plugin until we&#8217;ve built a few independent third-party applications on top of it when it&#8217;s in plugin form, utilizing every aspect of the API, so we know where it works well and where it&#8217;s lacking.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a lesson I&#8217;ve learned from my experience at Automattic. You can never design a perfect API and anticipate all needs, you really need to use it to solve real problems a few times before you can iterate it to have it be something that works well and that you&#8217;ll want to support for many years to come.</em></p>

<p>Seeing Mullenweg join the Facebook Group and then participate by answering questions was a shock to me. I know from experience that he likes to hang out where discussions of WordPress are taking place but it&#8217;s rare that I see him participate in the discussions, let alone host an impromptu Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see more of these types of events from Mullenweg whether it be on his blog or through a medium of his choice. Perhaps once a month, he can hold a Q&amp;A session at a different WordPress hangout.</p>
<p>The community can be a fickle bunch but I think it would be beneficial if he participated in more discussions outside of what&#8217;s going on in core. In <a title="http://www.mattcromwell.com/coder-troll-matt-mullenweg-walk-bar/" href="http://www.mattcromwell.com/coder-troll-matt-mullenweg-walk-bar/">his roundup post</a>, Matt Cromwell hits the nail on the head on what it means to some folks to have a direct conversation with Mullenweg.</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope Mullenweg drops by again in the future. For him it may have been a quick dip into the WP Community. But for boat loads of WordPress developers, it was the highlight of the week.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just out of curiosity, if you had one question to ask Mullenweg, what would it be?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 18:52:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>WP Tech is &#8220;breaking up with WordCamp,&#8221; according to co-organizer <a href="http://wabeo.fr/" target="_blank">Willy Bahuaud</a>. The developer-centric event, previously called <a href="http://wptavern.com/nantes-france-to-host-a-wordcamp-for-developers-in-november" target="_blank">WordCamp Nantes WP Tech</a>, is set to be held at the end of November and was welcomed as France&#8217;s second official WordCamp.</p>
<p>During the course of working with <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Central</a>, the organizers decided to opt out of keeping WP Tech under the WordCamp umbrella due to a number of conflicts.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordCamp Central gave us too many constraints, and we would not have been able to create a great technical event about WordPress,&#8221; co-organizer Daniel Roch told the Tavern. &#8220;It will be an independent WordPress tech event, like other great events such as Pressnomics, WPSessions, WordSesh or WordUps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organizing team found that some of the WC Central rules would have forced them to change the core concept of WP Tech. &#8220;In our case, we wanted to hold WP Tech as a national event, inviting speakers from France to a provincial town (Nantes),&#8221; said Bahuaud. However, this poses a problem, as WordCamps are meant to be <a href="http://plan.wordcamp.org/planning-details/speakers/" target="_blank">local events</a> and the majority of speakers have to be from the city where the event takes place.</p>
<p>The second critical conflict they encountered was regarding speaker expenses. &#8220;We want to cover speakers&#8217;s travel cost. WordCamp central was very firm with this point: we can&#8217;t. The WP Tech team was told that the only people&#8217;s expenses that can be covered are those who appear on the sidebar of <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217; about page</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;WC Central&#8217;s position is that traveling to speak at a conference is a legitimate business expense,&#8221; Bahuaud said. &#8220;But we think it&#8217;s not. We believe that if people spent time to prepare a conference, it&#8217;s normal to cover their $200 (on average) travel and accommodation costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, Bahuaud reports that the requirement to use the WordCamp platform for the event&#8217;s website was problematic, since it doesn&#8217;t allow for extensive customization. The event branding requirements were also an issue. Organizers changed the event name to &#8220;WordCamp Nantes WP Tech&#8221; but WC Central required further changes to make it compatible with guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four months before the event, rules were still changing and we had to be accountable on each step. It was very frustrating, so we decided to break up with WordCamp, and make our event separate,&#8221; Bahuaud explained.</p>
<h3>Cultural and Economic Differences Regarding Speaker Travel Guidelines</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jennybeaumont" target="_blank">Jenny Beaumont</a>, a WordPress developer and an active member of the French WordPress community, commented on the conflict with insight on the economic differences experienced by non-US event organizers:</p>
<blockquote><p>In France, a majority of people in the WordPress community are freelancers, and as such, many of us have a legal status that&#8217;s called an &#8216;auto-entrepreneur&#8217;. It&#8217;s part of what is known as a micro-regime that gives us a tax break on social contributions, which are very imposing here (45% for regular business owners). </p>
<p>The flip side to this is two-fold: 1) We have a ceiling on earnings, 2) We can&#8217;t deduct expenses. It&#8217;s this last fact that also influences the desire on the part of WordCamp organizers in France to want to reimburse speakers for their travels costs. WordCamp Paris has been doing it for years, though in light of recent events, may be prohibited from doing so in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas Americans are free to deduct work-related travel expenses as a business expense from their taxes, French speakers do not share that same privilege. At this point in time, WC Central guidelines don&#8217;t currently allow for flexibility on the issue of speaker travel, but the guidelines are not written in stone. WordCamp Central is open to further discussion on the matter.</p>
<p>Andrea Middleton <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/08/27/speaker-travel-for-wordcamps/" target="_blank">clarified the issue of speaker travel expenses</a> today on the make.wordpress.org Community blog. She highlighted the importance of WordCamps as local events and how paying for speaker travel costs doesn&#8217;t mesh well with that guideline:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordCamps are locally-focused, so there‚Äôs an inherent disconnect between paying for people from out of town to speak at a WordCamp and that emphasis on local community. Local experts are assets to their communities all year round, whereas visiting speakers don‚Äôt typically serve as ongoing resources once they have returned to their home cities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Middleton suggests the more cost-effective option of utilizing Skype or Google hangouts to pull in out-of-town speakers who are unable to cover their own travel expenses. The idea is that the WordCamp budget can be better used to serve the local community.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;A WordCamp‚Äôs primary focus is on connecting local community and lifting up local experts, rather than blowing our budgets on flying people around the world when technology can get them there so much faster,&#8221;</strong> she explained.</p>
<p>Community members who want to advocate a different opinion on the guidelines have the opportunity to do so. Middleton invites discussion in the comments of her <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/08/27/speaker-travel-for-wordcamps/" target="_blank">post</a>. She also plans to discuss the issue with contributors at the WordPress Community Summit in October, which will include WordCamp and meetup organizers from around the world. Data from WordCamp San Francisco&#8217;s new <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/location/travel-assistance/" target="_blank">travel assistance program</a> may also factor into the discussion.</p>
<p>Not every WordPress event has to be a WordCamp. It&#8217;s not a failure on the part of the organizers or WC Central if there are irreconcilable differences. If an event finds the WordCamp guidelines to be too problematic, organizers can host it as an independent event. WC Central exists to nurture local pockets of WordPress enthusiasm, but not every event will share that mission. There&#8217;s no mandate that all WordPress events have to be WordCamps and many successful events run outside of that umbrella.</p>
<p>Do you think the economic differences in other countries are an influencing factor regarding the creation of new WordCamps? Should cultural and economic differences come into play when it comes to officially-sanctioned WordCamp events?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 17:11:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The official release was targeted for the week of August 25th but will likely be arriving the following week.</p>

<p>The easiest way to test RC1 is to put the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin on a test site and start running through all the <a href="http://wptavern.com/preview-wordpress-4-0-features-beta-1-now-available-for-testing" target="_blank">new features</a>, many of which are highlighted on the 4.0 about page in the admin (wp-admin/about.php).

<p>The good news is that plugin and theme authors still have plenty of time to test their extensions against the release candidate for compatibility. Since <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-0-adds-custom-icons-to-the-plugin-installer" target="_blank">WordPress 4.0 adds icons to the admin plugin installer</a>, plugin developers will want to put their custom icons in place to improve visibility among all the auto-generated ones.</p>
<p>Over the past month of four beta releases, WordPress 4.0 has incorporated hundreds of fixes and refinements that make it truly a joy to use.

<p>Giving a plugin a top level admin menu between Dashboard and Posts is somewhat frowned upon among WordPress plugin developers. Although the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Menus" target="_blank">Administration Menus</a> section of the WordPress codex doesn&#8217;t outright forbid top level menus above Posts, plugin authors are strongly encouraged to consider placing their plugin&#8217;s menu underneath an existing WordPress top-level menu.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many plugins assume a higher level of importance by placing their admin menus above WordPress&#8217; core publishing features such as Posts, Comments, and Media. Jetpack is a prime example. As useful as the plugin is, its settings menu is not something that most users need to access more often than posts or comments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith created <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/" target="_blank">Menu Humility</a>, a plugin that reassigns the menu location for errant menu items. For example, if you use it on a site with Jetpack installed, it will put its admin menu at the very bottom below Settings.</p>
<p>Menu Humility is not a new plugin. In fact, it&#8217;s three years old &#8211; ancient in WordPress years. After testing the plugin today, I found that it&#8217;s still effective at stripping plugins of their assumed preeminence in the admin.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that most plugins don&#8217;t require top billing. If you feel that a top level menu item constitutes a plugin getting too big for its britches, then install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/" target="_blank">Menu Humility</a> plugin to bring it back down to its place.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 04:10:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered why Chris¬†Wiegman sold Better WP Security to iThemes, he <a title="http://www.chriswiegman.com/2014/08/sold-better-wp-security/" href="http://www.chriswiegman.com/2014/08/sold-better-wp-security/">answers the question</a> in a post on his personal site. The birth of Better WP Security started off as a mixture of features from several of his favorite security plugins. &#8220;I started mashing together features of some of the plugins I liked while adding in some of the functionality we wanted as a department (like &#8216;Away mode&#8217;) to produce something that I could manage myself and would make sure I kept off of anyone‚Äôs radar by not being hacked,&#8221;¬†Wiegman said.</p>
<p>Wiegman¬†goes on to describe the success the plugin had and how much money he was making in donations. At the peak of its popularity, it was downloaded over 1M times with $20,000 earned in donations. This prompted¬†Wiegman to create a premium support channel. &#8220;It was so big I was no longer able to keep up and had to implement premium support only for folks who needed it. This was a new revenue stream and the first official revenue stream for the plugin.&#8221; The surge of popularity came at a time when¬†Wiegman was teaching and reviewing books for APress. This severely limited the amount of time he had available to develop new features.</p>
<h2>iThemes Enters The Picture</h2>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29247]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10776" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg?resize=255%2C53" alt="iThemes logo 2" /></a>One day, the founder of iThemes, Cory Miller, reached out to¬†Wiegman for support after he was locked out of his site. &#8220;What started out as a rather simple conversation quickly lead to something more. I realized that the medicine the project needed to get off life support wasn‚Äôt necessarily something I needed to provide myself but could in fact come in the form of selling the plugin to a group who had the resources to make more of it,&#8221;¬†Wiegman said.</p>
<p>According to the post, he reached out to a few other groups but stuck with iThemes because they had products that complimented a security plugin such as BackupBuddy and Exchange. Better WP Security was <a title="http://wptavern.com/ithemes-acquires-better-wp-security-plugin-and-hires-wordpress-security-expert-chris-wiegman" href="http://wptavern.com/ithemes-acquires-better-wp-security-plugin-and-hires-wordpress-security-expert-chris-wiegman">sold to iThemes on December 1st, 2013</a> and renamed to <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/">iThemes Security</a>. As part of the deal,¬†Wiegman joined iThemes as a full-time employee to continue developing iThemes Security.</p>
<h2>Not Every Plugin Has a Happy Ending</h2>
<p>What I like most about Wiegman&#8217;s story is how a simple idea turns into a solid product. I think a lot of WordPress plugins are created because they scratch an itch or solve a problem. The plugin&#8217;s creator usually submits the plugin to the directory with a mindset that it can help others as well. Since WordPress is used on <a title="http://w3techs.com/" href="http://w3techs.com/">23% of the web</a>, there&#8217;s a good chance that a plugin distributed through the directory will help more than one person.</p>
<p>While Wiegman&#8217;s tale has a happy ending, so many plugins never reach the type of adoption of Better WP Security. In fact, quite a few end up in a <a title="http://wptavern.com/could-wordpress-plugin-adoption-lower-the-rate-of-abandonment" href="http://wptavern.com/could-wordpress-plugin-adoption-lower-the-rate-of-abandonment">graveyard of abandonment</a> for any number of reasons.

<p><a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/11/bbpress-2-5-released/" target="_blank">bbPress 2.5</a> introduced a host of new importers for AEF, Drupal, FluxBB, Kunena Forums (Joomla), MyBB, Phorum, PHPFox, PHPWind, PunBB, SMF, Xenforo and XMB, making it easier than ever to bring forums into WordPress. bbPress 2.5 also improved existing importers to include better support for importing stickies, topic tags, and forum categories.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about importing forums into bbPress or starting with a fresh installation, you may want to set up a test site first to see how different themes and plugins will work with your content. There&#8217;s nothing more tedious than trying to create a bunch of forums, topics, and replies manually, so you&#8217;ll need an automatic way to generate a bunch of demo data.</p>
<p>In searching for bbPress demo data, I found that there&#8217;s no standard way to generate it. Several developers have created and shared their own tools. Depending on your development workflow, one method may prove easier than another, so we&#8217;ll check out all three.</p>
<h3>XML: bbPress Unit Testing Data</h3>
<p>The first option is a set of <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2516" target="_blank">bbPress unit testing data</a> stored in an XML file, which allows you to import it via the standard WordPress import tool. The file was created by bbPress core commiter <a href="https://twitter.com/netweb" target="_blank">Stephen Edgar</a>. It gives you 17 forums, including 15 public, 1 private, and 1 hidden.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xml-demo-data.png" rel="prettyphoto[29172]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xml-demo-data.png?resize=923%2C490" alt="xml-demo-data" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29187" /></a></p>
<p>The demo data includes multiple topics and replies and also a group of forums and categories based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model" target="_blank">Nested set model</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/forums.png" rel="prettyphoto[29172]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/forums.png?resize=982%2C586" alt="forums" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29189" /></a></p>
<p>Technically, this unit testing data is still in process, as it&#8217;s currently hosted in <a href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2516" target="_blank">a ticket on bbPress trac</a> and is open to further improvement.</p>
<h3>Plugin: bbpFauxData</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MZAWeb/bbpFauxData" target="_blank">bbpFauxData</a> is another option created by WordPress developer <a href="http://mzaweb.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Dvorkin</a>. It&#8217;s a quick and dirty plugin to help you populate a bbPress instance with faux data which seems real, generated by the <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker" target="_blank">Faker</a> PHP library, in order to test performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bbpfauxdata.png" rel="prettyphoto[29172]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bbpfauxdata.png?resize=900%2C613" alt="bbpfauxdata" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29197" /></a></p>
<p>Once installed, you can set how many users, forums, topics and replies that you want to generate:</p>
<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
$bfd = new bbpFauxData();

const USERS   = 50;
const FORUMS  = 5;
const TOPICS  = 100;
const REPLIES = 1000;

for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; USERS; $i++ ) {
    $bfd-&gt;generate_user();
}

for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; FORUMS; $i++ ) {
    $bfd-&gt;generate_forum();
}

for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; TOPICS; $i++ ) {
    $bfd-&gt;generate_topic();
}

for ( $i = 0; $i &lt; REPLIES; $i++ ) {
    $bfd-&gt;generate_reply();
}</pre>
<p>This plugin gives you a little more control over how much demo data you want to generate, as it is geared more towards testing performance. Dvorkin suggests that you bump up the &#8216;max_execution_time&#8217; and &#8216;memory_limit&#8217;, if implementing this data at higher numbers.</p>
<h3>Plugin: Test Data for bbPress</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bbpress-test-data.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29172]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bbpress-test-data.jpg?resize=772%2C459" alt="bbpress-test-data" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29214" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.epicwebs.co.uk/bbpress-tutorials/test-data-for-bbpress-plugin/" target="_blank">Test Data for bbPress</a> is a plugin created by <a href="http://www.epicwebs.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rob Mehew</a>, who needed demo data while developing a theme. The plugin creates the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds a forum with nested forums</li>
<li>Adds a forum with loads of topics</li>
<li>Adds a topic with loads of replies</li>
</ul>
<p>Test Data for bbPress was created for the purpose of testing themes and includes lorem ipsum for sample text. As with all of the above options, this plugin should only be used on a development site; it is not designed for use on a live site.</p>
<p>Anyone have other bbPress demo data creation tools?

<p>The parent company of <a title="https://bruteprotect.com/" href="https://bruteprotect.com/">BruteProtect</a>, Parka, LLC has been <a title="http://jetpack.me/2014/08/26/automattic-bruteprotect/" href="http://jetpack.me/2014/08/26/automattic-bruteprotect/">acquired by Automattic</a> for an undisclosed amount. BruteProtect is a service providing <a title="http://wptavern.com/bruteprotect-protecting-against-brute-force-attacks" href="http://wptavern.com/bruteprotect-protecting-against-brute-force-attacks">brute force login protection</a> for thousands of WordPress sites. The <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bruteprotect/">BruteProtect plugin</a> will be phased out and rolled into <a title="http://jetpack.me/" href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a> and will¬† remain free to use. The services offered by <a title="https://my.bruteprotect.com/" href="https://my.bruteprotect.com/">BruteProtect pro</a> are now free for anyone to use. As part of the acquisition, all seven Parka employees will be employed by Automattic and will be part of the Jetpack development team.</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s merged into Jetpack, an announcement will be made to confirm the end-of-life date for the BruteProtect plugin. You won&#8217;t have to worry about managing two different API keys since it will function with the same key used by Jetpack. Unless you opt-out, BruteProtect will run at the same time as Jetpack. However, it&#8217;s unclear if it will be an auto-activated module when the merger is complete.</p>
<h2>The Origin Of BruteProtect</h2>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BruteProtectPluginHeader.png" rel="prettyphoto[28911]"><img class="size-full wp-image-28946" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BruteProtectPluginHeader.png?resize=808%2C257" alt="BruteProtect Plugin Header" /></a>BruteProtect Plugin Header
<p>In 2013, Matt Mullenweg published an article with his thoughts on <a title="http://ma.tt/2013/04/passwords-and-brute-force/" href="http://ma.tt/2013/04/passwords-and-brute-force/">passwords and brute force</a>. The article was published around the same time <a title="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/protecting-against-wordpress-brute-force-attacks.html" href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2013/04/protecting-against-wordpress-brute-force-attacks.html">a large botnet was using brute force techniques</a> to login to WordPress sites using Admin as the username. The article generated a healthy discussion on the <a title="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-April/045728.html" href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-April/045728.html">WP-Hackers mailing list</a>, especially around the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/">Limit Login Attempts plugin</a> which is commonly recommended to protect against unwanted login attempts.</p>
<p>The discussion <a title="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-April/045735.html" href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-April/045735.html">prompted Hotchkiss </a>to come up with a better solution. Instead of websites battling the problem alone, BruteProtect brought websites together to fight a common cause, similar to how Akismet works. Little did he know that he was writing his destiny.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another option to consider would be adding a &#8220;Security&#8221; plugin to Jetpack.</p>
<p>This could be used to manage a centralized blacklist, as well as to patch security vulnerabilities as they pop up. If all failed login attempts get reported back to Jetpack central, it could blacklist an IP for X minutes/hours after Y number of failed logins on any Jetpack-enabled site within Z minutes/hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since its launch, it&#8217;s been installed on <a title="https://bruteprotect.com/stats/" href="https://bruteprotect.com/stats/">106,836 sites</a> and defended against <a title="https://bruteprotect.com/stats/" href="https://bruteprotect.com/stats/">135,986,764</a> brute force attacks worldwide.</p>
<h2>BruteForce Protection For The Masses</h2>
<p>Having the product remain free was an important part of the acquisition. &#8220;I feel strongly that we need to be free and used by as many people as possible in order to provide the best protection and to do the most good,&#8221; Hotchkiss told the Tavern.</p>
<p>With BruteProtect now part of Jetpack, millions of websites will be protected from BruteForce login attempts and contribute to the centralized blacklist of IP addresses making the service much more effective. I think this is a huge win, especially for those who use Jetpack. Users don&#8217;t have to figure out technical jargon or difficult configuration settings.</p>

<p>Practically, this means that Crowd Favorite will contribute developers and other resources to help iThemes better structure and market their products beyond a consumer audience. iThemes will in turn list the enterprise versions of these products within their product pages, as well as work with Crowd Favorite to create enterprise-focused features for their core product base.</p>
<p>The products that are a focus of this collaboration are iThemes Sync, Exchange, Security, and BackupBuddy.</p>
<p>The announcement post calls it more than a distribution partnership, but a joint venture:</p>
<blockquote><p>The joint venture will be establishing an advisory board that will hold key executives from both companies consisting of myself, Cory Miller, Chris Lema, Matt Danner and Alex King. The goal will be to develop product roadmaps for our target market.</p>
<p>The result of this partnership is even greater alignment fueled by the African proverb widely quoted by both Miller and Lema ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;enterprise&#8221; market is an interesting thing in WordPress. There are companies and people working to make more enterprise-level WordPress products, but it&#8217;s still a product market that is in limbo. It&#8217;s so much more common¬†to cater to a consumer audience with different needs and desires; different products that cater to the¬†enterprise and corporate audience leaves room for a lot of experimentation.</p>
<p>Also noted in the blog post, Crowd Favorite CEO Karim Marucchi highlights three ways to enter a product space: product acquisition, talent acquisition, and &#8212; the route they are taking with this move &#8212; partnership.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know yet what pricing will look like for this deal, nor do I know exactly what the profit sharing breakdown is. I do know that both iThemes and Crowd Favorite leadership saw it as a no-brainer; and this is also one of the first strategic product moves lead by <a title="Interview with Chris Lema: a journey to working full time with WordPress" href="http://www.poststat.us/chris-lema-interview/">incoming Crowd Favorite CTO</a> Chris Lema.</p>
<p>Crowd Favorite hopes to market the enterprise-portion of iThemes&#8217; product suite to corporations, as well as other high-end WordPress and web development agencies. They&#8217;re already a bit of a trend-setter in that world &#8212; I believe &#8212; with their comparatively¬†high-priced <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/ramp/">RAMP</a> content deployment¬†product. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of that product, which has a very specific task that&#8217;s pretty high value, and they charge for it appropriately.</p>
<p>You can learn more on <a href="http://ithemes.com/2014/08/26/going-far-together-crowd-favorite-ithemes/">iThemes&#8217; announcement post</a>, as well as <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/08/ithemes-crowd-favorite-partner-in-new-product-development/">Crowd Favorite&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<p>I see this venture with iThemes as different route for getting access to more products with that goal in mind, and it seems like a win-win from my point of view. I certainly don&#8217;t think this is the last such partnership we&#8217;ll see, but rather a sign of things to come.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 14:16:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Editorial access is a capability granted only to Administrator and Editor <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" target="_blank">user roles</a> in WordPress. This access is not easily shared to other roles without changing a user&#8217;s role or adding extra capabilities. There are several complex plugins out there that will allow you to create custom roles and manage capabilities. But what if you only need to change editorial access for a few posts or pages?</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-access-manager/" target="_blank">Editorial Access Manager</a> is a simple plugin that lets you control who has access to which posts. It was created by 10up engineer <a href="http://taylorlovett.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Lovett</a>, who found that the default roles were inadequate for certain one-off situations. The plugin lets you assign which users or roles have access to specific posts. It adds a meta box to the post editor where you can set editorial access:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/editorial-access-manager.png" rel="prettyphoto[28603]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/editorial-access-manager.png?resize=747%2C454" alt="editorial-access-manager" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29155" /></a></p>
<p>Editorial Access Manager has no other settings besides the meta box for each post. For safety reasons, the site administrator will always be able to edit any post. Editorial access is limited to roles that have the &#8220;edit_posts&#8221; capability, so the Subscriber role is not available by default.</p>
<p>Sometimes creating a new user role is overkill for just a handful of posts or pages. That&#8217;s where the Editorial Access Manager plugin comes in handy, particularly for large publications or multi-author blogs. Perhaps you have a contributor or author who you want to pull in to edit a particular post. This plugin is ideal for that kind of scenario. You can <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-access-manager/" target="_blank">download</a> it for free from WordPress.org or the plugin&#8217;s home on <a href="http://github.com/tlovett1/editorial-access-manager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 02:23:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

It integrates with issue tracking, supports markdown, notifications, and has an activity feed featuring multiple third-party integrations.</p>
<p>In order to use Gitter, you&#8217;ll need to sign in using your GitHub account.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ActiveChannelOnGitter.png" rel="prettyphoto[29067]"><img class="size-full wp-image-29093" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ActiveChannelOnGitter.png?resize=1025%2C536" alt="Active Channel On Gitter" /></a>Active Channel On Gitter
<p>As you can see from the screenshot above, channels are on the left with the main text window in the center. Users and their online status are shown on the top-right side of the window along with a tab to switch between people and repository information. Activity related to the GitHub repository is displayed below the user information.</p>
<h2>WordPress Projects Already Using Gitter</h2>
<p>The <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/options-meta/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/options-meta/">Metadata UI API</a> and <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/tag/image-flow/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/tag/image-flow/">Image Flow</a> WordPress projects are already utilizing Gitter in place of IRC to handle real-time communications during meetings. Unlike IRC where log files are stored on individual machines, Gitter logs the conversation for as long as the channel is active. This makes it convenient to keep tabs on previous meetings and to maintain an archive. There&#8217;s also a <a title="https://developer.gitter.im/docs/messages-resource" href="https://developer.gitter.im/docs/messages-resource">JSON feed of the messages</a> allowing the archived content to be stored off-site.</p>
<p>When I asked Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Metadata UI API project, why they chose to use Gitter instead of IRC, he replied with the following reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Public rooms are public, you don‚Äôt have to be a user or contributor in the room to read.</li>
<li>Easy sign up (using GitHub.com account)</li>
<li>Continuous chat (easy to catch up, sync up between timezones especially)</li>
<li>The latest activity in GitHub is displayed next to chat window. You can see what‚Äôs going on and who‚Äôs doing what throughout the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>IRC doesn&#8217;t support media or markdown which are two distinct traits that come in handy when working with GitHub projects.</p>

<p>Gitter provides a few different notification settings. You can be notified of all messages, just those addressed to you, or turn on Lurk Mode. If you want to be notified even when the browser is closed, Gitter <a title="https://gitter.im/apps" href="https://gitter.im/apps">has an app available</a> for iOS and Mac OSX. An app for Android will be released at a later date.</p>
<h2>As The Beta Concludes, Gitter Announces Pricing Plans</h2>
<p>According to an email released to testers last week, the service is moving out of beta. During the beta program, nearly 25,000 developers registered with Gitter, 1.8M chat messages were delivered, and is hosting over 7,000 chat rooms. As part of the move, the service is introducing paid plans.</p>
<p>If you created a private conversation during the beta, it will remain free to use. Additionally, every organization on GitHub will receive one free private room as part of the free plan. If you&#8217;re a student or educational organization, you can get in touch with <a href="mailto:support@gitter.im" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">support@gitter.im</a> to receive a discount code. Here&#8217;s what the pricing structure will look like when the beta concludes.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GitterPricing.png" rel="prettyphoto[29067]"><img class="size-full wp-image-29116" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GitterPricing.png?resize=553%2C1073" alt="Gitter Pricing Plans" /></a>Gitter Pricing Plans
<p>Near the end of the email, Gitter states one of the goals for the company is to keep the service 100% ad-free.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our goal is to keep Gitter 100% ad-free so that we can entirely focus our attention on building a great product without having to worry about weird money making schemes that aren&#8217;t directly aligned the vision of the company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The service is expected to conclude its beta program this week or next.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a real-time communication platform that integrates seamlessly with your GitHub project, consider using Gitter. After testing the service, I found it to be straightforward and easy to use.</p>

<p>WordPress <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">global usage</a> on the web is now at 23%, and this year marked the first time that non-English downloads surpassed the number of English downloads. Major internationalization <a href="http://wptavern.com/major-internationalization-improvements-planned-for-wordpress-4-0" target="_blank">improvements</a> coming in 4.0 will open up the platform even more for those publishing in different languages.</p>
<p>While discussing the upcoming language-related improvements at WordCamp Seattle this year, Andrew Nacin <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/483035345551106048" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the fact that only 5-10% of the world speaks English. It may not be long before the majority of WordPress installations are in Mandarin, Spanish, Hindi, or Arabic.</p>
<p>The need for better ways to support multilingual content is already a concern for many international users and agencies. One thing that WordPress core is currently missing is the ability to easily retrieve the language in which a post or page has been written. German WordPress developer <a href="http://glueckpress.com/" target="_blank">Caspar H√ºbinger</a> is in the early stages of creating a <a href="https://github.com/glueckpress/wordpress-post-language" target="_blank">proposal to add a Post Language feature to core</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Does WordPress Need Post Language Support?</h2>
<p>In outlining the need for post language support, H√ºbinger cites WordPress download stats from the end of April, demonstrating that 3.9 had been downloaded roughly 1.36 times more often in other languages than the default US English:</p>
<p><strong>Total Core downloads:</strong> 6,589,287 (100%)<br />
<strong>Default English:</strong> 2,807,978 (42.6%)<br />
<strong>Others:</strong> 3,781,309 (57.4%)</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/glueckpress/wordpress-post-language/blob/master/assets/img/2014-04-29_17-11-48.png?raw=true" target="_blank">Data</a> from April 29, 2014)</p>
<p>H√ºbinger wants to add post_language as a property of <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Post" target="_blank">WP_Post</a> just like post_author, post_excerpt, and the other variables.</p>
<p>&#8220;Offering a basic opportunity to users for them to store the language of their content along with other post meta information would provide a new level of empowerment for both, users and developers,&#8221; H√ºbinger contends.</p>
<p>His proposal is based on the premise that the language of post content serves as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a highly relevant piece of post meta information in general</li>
<li>one of the most important parameters for plugin and theme developers to tackle the already complex field of language and translation</li>
</ul>
<p>Many plugins, in the course of providing translation features, require the ability to determine the language a post was written in, but they all go about it in different ways. Portability is abysmal across plugins such as WPML, Polylang, Babble, Multilingual Press, and others that provide a similar functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>All</em> of those plugins, however, do much more than just determining the language of a post,&#8221; H√ºbinger told the Tavern. &#8220;They offer UIs for translating content and establishing language relationships between single posts ‚Äî a field so complex that being built without any core method for language determination, each one of those plugins can become a major headache when a user tries to switch from one plugin to another.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a user you‚Äôre pretty much locked in to the solution you choose, since not only are connections between original posts and translations gone when you switch plugins, but also the very marker of which language a post is written in simply vanishes or becomes ineffective,&#8221; H√ºbinger explained. If WordPress had a standard way to determine the language in which a post was written, all of these plugins could potentially provide more portable functionality.</p>
<h3>The Proposed Post Language Feature</h3>
<p>So what would Post Language look like as a feature implemented in WordPress? In addition to providing developers with more tools to add custom language and translation features, post language would also allow users to assign a language selection in the Publish Post meta box:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post-lanugage-publish-box.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[29062]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post-lanugage-publish-box.jpg?resize=673%2C287" alt="post-lanugage-publish-box" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29097" /></a></p>
<p>H√ºbinger proposes that the select box be populated with the languages previously defined through either the language packs available within the given WordPress install, or a filter. The language selection would return the ISO code for that language and store it in a database field as post meta or an extra field that would have to be added to the database table.</p>
<p>The value for Post Language could then be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>should be made accessible through template tags:<br />
<code>the_post_language()</code><br />
<code>get_the_post_language()</code></li>
<li>should possibly affect<br />
<code>get_bloginfo( 'language' )</code><br />
<code>get_bloginfo( 'text-direction' )</code><br />
and thus <code>language_attributes()</code></li>
<li>OR should be implemented via a new attribute on a per-post basis, similar to <code>post_class():</code>
<ul>
<li><code>post_language()</code></p>
<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate">&lt;article &lt;?php post_class(); ?&gt; &lt;?php post_language(); ?&gt;&gt;
// ouput:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;article class="foo bar" lang="en-US"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since not all WordPress sites would need this feature, he suggests that it be disabled by default and enabled via a constant, a filter or perhaps an admin setting under Settings > General.</p>
<p>H√ºbinger <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/21/internationalization-goals-for-4-0/#comment-14913" target="_blank">mentioned</a> his idea in a comment on Andrew Nacin&#8217;s roadmap for 4.0 internationalization improvements, but he decided to wait until 4.0 is in place before officially proposing the feature. Adding a new property to WP_Post is a major consideration and will likely encounter a healthy debate.</p>
<h3>Post Language Support Falls In Line with WordPress&#8217; Mission to Democratize Publishing</h3>
<p>Unlike various other CMSs, such as Drupal and Typo3, WordPress does not provide a core feature to publish translations of original content. &#8220;You can‚Äôt even just publish single posts in more than one language per site without messing up your markup with false language attributes,&#8221; H√ºbinger notes. &#8220;Not a problem? Try to get a machine reading a post to you in any other language than English when its markup says it is written in English. You‚Äôll most certainly hear the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>H√ºbinger believes that raising awareness is key for the Post Language feature to gain momentum. &#8220;Language on a per post basis is generally associated with translation in people‚Äôs minds, and rightfully so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Translation, though, has always been an edge case scenario for our mainly anglophone WordPress core dev team, and rightfully so as well.&#8221; Convincing the WordPress community of the case for adding Post Language to core is the first step to making it a viable possibility.</p>
<p>The lack of a post language field juxtaposed with the existence of post formats in core is a continual source of bewilderment for H√ºbinger, who comes from a multilingual culture.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I like to say if we have a visual carnival like post formats in core, it is high time to spend some thought on a language API which potentially will affect and benefit a couple of millions more users than fancy post formats,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;Nothing against post formats; I like them. They just make such good contrast when comparing the importance of core features.&#8221;</p>
<p>His proposal makes a compelling case for the international community and appeals to the heart of WordPress&#8217; core mission to democratize publishing.</p>
<blockquote><p>After all, WordPress is all about publishing content, and content inevitably has to do with language. We can‚Äôt honestly claim to &#8216;democratize publishing&#8217; while we continue to ignore the relevance of linguistic aspects regarding content for WordPress users around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>H√ºbinger believes that a Post Language feature can help the project enter a higher level of maturity with one small API feature addition. &#8220;While the whole field of translating and multilingual content rightfully has been and will be outsourced into plugin territory, WordPress core needs to provide at least a basic language-per-post API for plugin authors to work with, thus preventing users from locking themselves in with one solution forever,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>H√ºbinger readily admits that the feature is beyond his coding capabilities and hopes that other developers will join the effort to establish a path for architecture and implementation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am <em>totally</em> open to any self-respecting developers who would like to contribute, fork the repo, set up their own one for the same idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is about making WordPress better for millions of non-anglophone users, so let‚Äôs just get that language API in there in the most decent manner possible!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once WordPress 4.0 is released with improved multilingual support, H√ºbinger hopes to drum up more support and contributors to work on the project before officially proposing it to core.

<p>Envato has announced a change in support terms for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon, which creates a requirement for authors to provide six months of support, and offers buyers &#8220;support packs&#8221; for renewing support.</p>
<p>Support has not historically been required, but nearly every author notes that support is essentially required for sales purposes. From the <a href="http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/">Envato market blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our most successful Authors talk about the support they provide being a key part of their success, and most of our authors advertise that they provide support and have done so for some time. However support has not been an intrinsic part of the system and site mechanics.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new terms are a bit nuanced and will be a bit more complicated for authors that don&#8217;t currently offer support. There are also a number of questions left to answer, which Collis Ta&#8217;eed &#8212; Envato&#8217;s CEO &#8212; notes in the post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support will be limited to 6 months</li>
<li>Additional support can be purchased in &#8220;support packs&#8221;, though I&#8217;m not sure how that will be structured</li>
<li>Support packs will be 70% author revenue, and 30% fee to Envato (something authors seem slightly unhappy about so far, based on what I&#8217;ve seen)</li>
<li>New rules will be put into effect December 1st</li>
<li>Updates will remain part of the initial purchase</li>
</ul>
<p>Envato hasn&#8217;t decided yet how long support packs will last, nor how much they will cost. They are also working out details for support promises, such as how long customers should expect for response times. The announcement post also addresses the very legitimate concern for the definition of support. They clearly state it will be a strict definition to prevent authors from having to provide unreasonable support.</p>
<p>Collis also did not note whether initial item prices will increase to account for the added support requirement. Considering so many authors provide it under the current model, they may not raise prices at all; though it&#8217;d be a great time to do it.</p>
<p>Collis also notes that unlimited plans are potentially unsustainable, which is quite a statement for a marketplace that has limited authors to that model for years:</p>
<blockquote><p>We‚Äôre capping support at 6 months because the ‚Äòlifetime‚Äô support that authors sometime promise is often not economically sustainable and ultimately leads to more bad buyer experiences than good. For most buyers, the first few months represents the time when most help is needed. After six months,that ongoing support really is a premium request to the author and should be treated as such. There‚Äôs already plenty of signs that this is where the industry is headed.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my final questions about this move is in regard to how ThemeForest will create support channels. Many ThemeForest and CodeCanyon authors have already created alternative support channels through their own websites, often citing ThemeForest&#8217;s system as difficult to manage. I assume authors will still be able to maintain existing systems, but may have to make adjustments for being able to manage support packs and whatnot within¬†their platforms.</p>
<p>I definitely think this is a good change for Envato to make; it&#8217;s honestly way past time. However, I understand why it&#8217;s taken a while; as the announcement post indicates, there&#8217;s a lot to consider and it&#8217;s not an easy change. That&#8217;s why they are announcing it now and waiting until December to implement the changes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be very interested to¬†hear from authors about how they feel about this change. I have a feeling that a minority of buyers would actually buy support packs, though if they do that will be a nice benefit¬†for authors to make more money on support-heavy customers.</p>

<p>BuddyPress 2.1 is right around the corner with <a href="http://buddypress.org/2014/08/buddypress-2-1-beta-1/" target="_blank">Beta 1</a> landing in the hands of eager testers today. The upcoming release includes several improvements that make BuddyPress easier to use, more secure, and faster than ever.</p>
<p>BP 2.1 is set to introduce a totally revamped @mentions interface with built-in auto-suggestion and beta testers will want to put it through the paces. Here&#8217;s a quick demo:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mentions.gif" rel="prettyphoto[28832]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mentions.gif?resize=655%2C443" alt="mentions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29048" /></a></p>
<p>The brand new URL profile field type is also making its way into this release. It automatically creates a link from the URL entered in the profile field.</p>
<p>Highlights for the upcoming release demonstrate continual improvement on the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>New @mentions interface: type a @ when leaving a status update or commenting on an activity item or blog post, and the new suggestions panel will open.</li>
<li>Set better passwords with the password strength meter on the registration and user settings pages</li>
<li>When a user attempts to change their email address, the new address requires email verification before the change is applied</li>
<li>New ‚ÄúURL‚Äù XProfile field type</li>
<li>Continued performance enhancements, particularly on the Members and Groups directories.</li>
<li>Higher quality translations (automatically fetched by WordPress), courtesy of BP translation volunteers</li>
</ul>
<p>BuddyPress 2.1 also includes a lot of under-the-hood tweaks. This release offers <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5418" target="_blank">better compatibility</a> with themes that load template content in advanced ways, such as Stargazer. It will also formally <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5390/" target="_blank">deprecate the BuddyBar</a>. The term &#8220;Avatar&#8221; has been <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5758" target="_blank">renamed</a> to &#8220;Profile Photo,&#8221; which is more universally understood and translatable.</p>
<p>All of the features and improvements above could use testing. Grab a cold beverage and take the beta for a spin this weekend. You can download a zip from the <a href="http://buddypress.org/2014/08/buddypress-2-1-beta-1/" target="_blank">Beta 1 announcement post</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 18:54:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>WordPress 4.0 release lead <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/helen" target="_blank">Helen Hou-Sand√≠</a> recently gave an in-depth preview of the upcoming release at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/" target="_blank">WordPress NYC Meetup</a>. Her presentation gives a complete overview of the new features that you will see in the official release next week.</p>
<p>Part of Hou-Sand√≠&#8217;s responsibility as the release lead is to help shape the scope, goals and features merged into WordPress. Her presentation includes context for each feature landing in 4.0. She covers how WordPress worked before the new features were added and explains the reasons behind each addition.</p>
<p>She also gives the audience an overview of what it&#8217;s like to lead a release and offers insight on managing a large group of volunteers on an open source project. At the end of the presentation she answers more specific questions from meetup attendees.</p>

The project&#8217;s marketplace, which now boasts more than 100 <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a> and dozens of <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/themes/" target="_blank">themes</a>, shows no signs of slowing down. With global WordPress usage on the rise and digital downloads becoming an increasingly popular vehicle of commerce, EDD is well-positioned to corner the market on download delivery.</p>
<p>Developers looking to start creating add-ons for the platform have a new tool at their disposal. The <a href="https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/EDD-Extension-Boilerplate" target="_blank">EDD Extension Boilerplate</a> gives you a head start on building an extension that conforms to EDD coding standards.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edd-extension-boilerplate.png" rel="prettyphoto[28895]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edd-extension-boilerplate.png?resize=1025%2C915" alt="edd-extension-boilerplate" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28983" /></a></p>
<p>The boilerplate was created by WordPress developer <a href="http://ghost1227.com/" target="_blank">Dan Griffiths</a>. His objective was to create a solid foundation for EDD extension developers to use when building their own creations. The advantages of using the boilerplate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Plugin Boilerplate is fully-based on the WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API" target="_blank">Plugin API</a>.</li>
<li>Uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc" target="_blank">PHPDoc</a> conventions to document the code.</li>
<li>Example values are given, so you can see what needs to be changed.</li>
<li>Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The boilerplate comes in the form of a plugin that you install, although it has no real functionality in WordPress. After adding it, you&#8217;ll need to follow all of the <a href="https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/EDD-Extension-Boilerplate#configuration" target="_blank">configuration instructions</a> in the readme file for renaming all instances of &#8216;plugin-name&#8217; with that of your plugin.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edd-extension-boilerplate-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[28895]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edd-extension-boilerplate-settings.png?resize=1025%2C471" alt="edd-extension-boilerplate-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28989" /></a></p>
<p>The boilerplate also includes libraries, assets, and css/img/js subdirectories as placeholders, so you can easily organize your files. The idea is to tweak a few things in the boilerplate so you can quickly get to the task of coding your add-on, without having to wonder if you&#8217;re structuring everything the right way.

They were, and still are, little more than an organizational feature that allows themes to support ten custom content formats such as asides, links, quotes, video, and audio. They are just a taxonomy ‚Äî similar to categories and tags ‚Äî and are restricted to whatever the active theme supports.</p>
<p>The concept for post formats made sense at the time, though even then it was a <a href="http://wpcandy.com/presents/wordpress-3-1-feature-overview/#.U_deZYBdWiQ">topic of intense debate</a>. Post formats in 3.1 were supposed to be an introduction of the feature, to be iterated on once themes began to show how they would use them. In WordPress 3.6 there was an effort to establish a consistent UI, which failed to land in core. I believe they‚Äôve been dying a slow death ever since.</p>
<h3>Were we just chasing a competitor?</h3>
<p>When post formats were discussed and launched, they felt like an attempt to mimic what Tumblr was doing so well ‚Äî to make it easy for end users and bloggers to create nicely formatted content for specific content structures.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7089" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post-format-meta-box.png" alt="post-format-meta-box" width="306" height="274" />The problem with post formats is that they have no standard user interface and there is no intuitive¬†standard for how themes should implement storage for post format data, beyond a general recommendation that everything should be stored in the <code>post_content</code>. Additionally, support for post formats is primarily reliant on the active theme, and keeping post format consistency when switching themes is difficult.</p>
<p>With these struggles combined, post formats have faced issues on nearly all fronts: users hardly understand how to utilize them, theme authors can offer very little consistency for supporting them, and without mass adoption core developers have a hard time investing their efforts to improve the features.</p>
<h3>There have been some impressive efforts to standardize post formats</h3>
<p><span id="more-7087"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_7090" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-7090 size-full" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cf-post-format-ui.png" alt="cf-post-format-ui" width="703" height="383" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Alex King&#8217;s post format UI</p></div>
<p>Alex King and Crowd Favorite <a href="https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats">created a tabbed UI</a> not long after the feature came out, and it was the basis for the discussion for including post formats into core. But this UI required inclusion either as a drop-in to a theme ‚Äî which is a bit heavy handed for a theme ‚Äî or to be included a a plugin.</p>
<p>Under that structure, the post format UI was reliable and sufficient for client work, where a developer set it up for the client; but it‚Äôs not an effective route for mass adoption amongst users and those that want to use it with whatever theme they have.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it used custom fields for storage of things like link addresses and video URLs, which then would not transfer to another system or if the user decided to abandon post formats altogether.</p>
<div id="attachment_7091" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-7091" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post-formats-in-core-752x203.png" alt="Core post format UI during beta" width="627" height="169" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Core post format UI during beta</p></div>
<p>Therefore, WordPress 3.6 post format UI faced battles¬†on many fronts: data storage, user interface, fallback mechanisms, and battles with altogether different concepts (like content blocks, for instance).</p>
<p>Eventually, after much debate ‚Äî and very late in the game, during the Release Candidate stage ‚Äî a <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/">post format UI was removed from WordPress 3.6</a>, with many amongst the core team basically expressing that a much more low level content problem needed to be solved.</p>
<blockquote><p>I fought hard for it, and a lot of people put a lot of effort into it. But the result just isn‚Äôt compelling, or obvious, or any of the things that it should be. It‚Äôs not just a matter of polish, it seems to be a fundamental issue with the concept.</p></blockquote>
<p>There were some pretty great things in that 3.6 code that would‚Äôve been tremendous for post format support, even without a consistent UI. However, most new code was meant for that UI and was removed as a part of the revert. This included methods for automatically separating content within the UI so it can be called by themes as separate functions.</p>
<h3>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing that post formats are dying</h3>
<p>I tend to think, looking back, that perhaps we were too strongly responding to alternative content entry methods with post formats, versus creating our own strong ideas for how WordPress can better support rich media and custom content structures.</p>
<p>Now, conversations are more often centered around creating intuitive UI and then worry about putting things back into the content; themes like <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/">Make</a> and plugins like <a href="http://velocitypage.com/">Velocity Page</a> are good examples of these structures. Before, we were trying to extract stuff from the main content so we could use it how we want on the presentation side of things.</p>
<p>Additionally, I question whether the right decisions were made about structure for post formats themselves. Did we really need to restrict post formats to ten standard ones, with no supported¬†methods for extendability? And what is the difference between asides and status?¬†And we included formats like chat, which seems like an edge case at best. There&#8217;s little use crying over spilled milk, but perhaps in hindsight some things up front could&#8217;ve helped the feature long term.</p>
<p>Finally, when we can create much more unique content structures with custom post types, or simply with custom meta boxes within posts, did we really need post formats? What were we achieving by making these organizational standards?</p>
<p>Custom post types for things like links, videos, and audio make a lot of sense to me, and issues like including those in primary RSS feeds, in home screen feeds, and other post-esque things are pretty easy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the definition of a post itself is evolving. Today we often read posts that include all types of media that is not always easy to reproduce within the confines of <code>the_content</code>; consider ‚Äústory‚Äù style content that‚Äôs become so popular in many journalism organizations.</p>
<h3>Post formats weren‚Äôt a failure. Investing more in them may be though.</h3>
<p>Post formats weren‚Äôt a failure. There were some excellent theme experiments done with them; <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/collections/">Collections</a> comes to mind, as does <a href="http://www.poststat.us/category/planet/feed/twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com">Twenty Thirteen</a>. They had promise, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem the best way forward anymore for highlighting non-standard content. I think the concept gives too little credit to content in the first place; for instance, what if a post has video, audio, and quotes? How does that fit in a post format organizational schema?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think people have to start ignoring alternative display methods for things they may currently identify as ‚Äúpost format material.‚Äù Creativity will and should survive with displaying post content in themes; but I don‚Äôt believe that doing it through post formats is the best way.</p>
<p>And if we do double down on post formats (I really don‚Äôt think we will), then there will need to be some really serious iterations on the presentation, because since inception the UI has been in no-mans-land.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad WordPress had this experiment with post formats. I think it helped evolve our collective thinking about content and the many shapes of it.</p>
<p>I also don‚Äôt think we should just go and deprecate the feature; I think deprecation can happen naturally, as fewer themes support post formats out of the box.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd rather see themes and plugins create more creative, intuitive, and eventually standard methods for highlighting all kinds of content, in a way that allows site owners to manage and access that content whether those methods are active or not.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 15:45:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>When we wrote a <a title="http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts" href="http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts">review about WP Inject</a> earlier this year, we were impressed with its features. However, we felt that it was somewhat unfortunately named. As <a title="http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts#comment-53110" href="http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts#comment-53110">Dave Tasker notes</a> within the comments of the review, the word <em>inject</em> invokes thoughts of security vulnerabilities. &#8220;In my humble opinion, the things that spring to my mind when I see the word injection in the WordPress context are code injection exploit and sql injection exploit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only has <a title="http://wpscoop.com" href="http://wpscoop.com">Thomas H√∂fter</a> renamed the plugin to <a title="http://wpscoop.com/wp-inject/" href="http://wpscoop.com/wp-inject/">ImageInject</a>, he released version 1.1 which contains some noteworthy features. H√∂fter explains in the announcement post why he didn&#8217;t name the plugin ImageInject to begin with.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why did I not name the plugin ImageInject to begin with? In part because when I first released it, <strong>I had a different scope</strong> in mind: I was planning to make WP Inject a platform for inserting lots of things besides just images, including videos and affiliate products. Those plans did not die with the name change but I decided that once they become a reality, they will be better off moved into their own plugin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Version 1.1 introduces support for image captions. Image captions are an excellent and convenient way to display attribution information. Captions are displayed next to the image. This means they&#8217;ll move with the image if you decide to change its alignment.</p>

<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/log-emails/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/log-emails/">Log Emails</a> lets you log your outgoing emails to the WordPress database for analysis. Access is restricted to administrators. Emails with WordPress passwords are obfuscated for security and privacy. This plugin is useful for diagnosing email problems. The logs are automatically purged after a defined period, adjusted through a settings page in the WordPress admin. Setting the period to 0 prevents logs from being purged. Deactivating the plugin purges all logs.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dashboard-notes/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dashboard-notes/">WP Dashboard Notes</a> is a new way to display notes and to-do lists in the Admin Dashboard. They are presented just like Post-It notes. This is a great plugin if you are developing a site or have multiple authors publishing content on your site.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-post-expiration/" title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-post-expiration/">Simple Post Expiration</a> is a simple plugin that allows you to set an expiration date on posts. Once a post is expired, <strong>Expired</strong> will be prefixed to the post title. You can alter the behavior of this plugin using a short code with five different parameters.</p>

The <a href="http://wptavern.com/preview-wordpress-4-0-features-beta-1-now-available-for-testing" target="_blank">upcoming 4.0 release</a> completely revamps the plugin search and installation process with plugin cards arranged in a new grid view. Andrew Nacin <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that plugins will also have their own icons in the installer.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/akismet-details.png" rel="prettyphoto[28923]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/akismet-details.png?resize=651%2C235" alt="akismet-details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28927" /></a></p>
<p>Plugin authors are at liberty to create their own custom 128px square icons, as seen in the Akismet example above. Nacin outlines the specific criteria for custom icons in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plugin icons are 128 pixels square. HiDPI (retina) icons are supported at 256 pixels square. Like banners, these go into your /assets directory and can be either a PNG or JPG. So just create assets/icon-128&#215;128.(png|jpg) and/or assets/icon-256&#215;256.(png|jpg) and you have an icon.</p>
<p>You also have another option: SVG. Vectors are perfect for icons like this, as they can be scaled to any size and the file itself is small. For an SVG file, you simply need an assets/icon.svg file.</p></blockquote>
<p>If a plugin does not have a custom icon in place, an auto-generated icon will appear in the installer instead. Default icons are created from a color sampling of your plugin banner (done via <a href="https://github.com/mtias/tonesque" target="_blank">Tonesque</a>) and generated using the <a href="https://github.com/jasonlong/geo_patter" target="_blank">Geo Pattern</a> library. This is all the more reason to add a custom banner to your plugin&#8217;s page on WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/geo-patterns.png" rel="prettyphoto[28923]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/geo-patterns.png?resize=654%2C393" alt="geo-patterns" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28936" /></a></p>
<p>Nacin credits <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/tellyworth" target="_blank">Alex Shiels</a> for his work on this beautiful new feature for the plugin installer.</p>
<p>If you are a plugin author and you want to have a custom icon in place when WordPress 4.0 launches, you can add one now. A custom icon will help your plugin stand out among the auto-generated icons. Check out Nacin&#8217;s <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/08/21/introducing-plugin-icons-in-the-plugin-installer/" target="_blank">tips on creating a custom icon</a> for more information.  WordPress 4.0 will be landing <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-0-project-schedule/" target="_blank">the week of August 25th</a>. While you&#8217;re adding your icon, there&#8217;s still plenty of time to test your plugin with 4.0 to ensure its compatibility.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 19:45:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The folks at WordPress.com VIP are continuing to add to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-vip-releases-presentation-documents-and-resources-under-creative-commons-license" target="_blank">Documattic</a>, a repository dedicated to sharing presentations and resources with the WordPress community. While the repository already contains some solid resources for WordPress in enterprise and government, today&#8217;s addition may have the widest reach, as it pertains to user education.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/Documattic/tree/master/Presentations/Superuser_Training_Slides" target="_blank">WordPress.com VIP Superuser Training Course</a> is now open source on GitHub for anyone to use. The course was designed to provide editorial and administrative training for administrators of multi-author sites and is used by VIP instructors for WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/training/" target="_blank">VIP Training Day</a> events.</p>
<p>Comprised of 300+ slides, the training course is well-organized and comprehensive, covering important topics such as user management, creating posts, managing tags and categories, comment moderation and more. The slides were created with <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/" target="_blank">reveal.js</a>, so they can be presented within any browser and easily edited with HTML.</p>

<h3>Everything You Need to Guide Users Through the Publishing Process</h3>
<p>This course is immensely valuable for any WordPress agency that provides in-person training for clients. It helps new WordPress administrators get up to speed on managing content and even contains exercises for students to practice during the course. To get a full view of the breadth of this course, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/Documattic/tree/master/Presentations/Superuser_Training_Slides#index-of-the-presentation-sections" target="_blank">index of the presentation sections</a>, which includes the corresponding slide numbers.</p>
<p>While the intended purpose of the course is to train WordPress beginners, the WordPress.com VIP team recommends that it be delivered by an instructor. The slides are not meant to stand alone but rather to serve as a tool for teachers to train site administrators, site owners, and editors of large multi-author sites.</p>
<p>You can put videos and tutorials inside the WordPress admin, but nothing replaces a hands-on teaching experience. It is by far the best way to build confidence in new administrators. The <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/Documattic/tree/master/Presentations/Superuser_Training_Slides" target="_blank">WordPress.com VIP Superuser Training Course</a> essentially gives you the material to provide a full day&#8217;s worth of WordPress training to your clients.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the business of WordPress, then you need to bookmark the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/Documattic" target="_blank">Documattic</a> repo, as it houses a wealth of knowledge on marketing the platform and educating users.

<p>If you&#8217;re managing a multisite network where you&#8217;ve created a long list of sites, the &#8220;My Sites&#8221; menu in the admin bar can get so lengthy that it becomes difficult to navigate. 10up engineer <a href="http://kaileylampert.com/" target="_blank">Kailey Lampert</a> designed an elegant solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/trepmal/my-sites-search" target="_blank">My Sites Search</a> plugin does exactly what it says on the label. Once installed, it adds a search bar to filter the &#8220;My Sites&#8221; menu in WordPress multisite. It narrows the site list down as you type, making it simple to locate a site in your list.</p>
<p>Before you install the plugin, your site list might look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/before.png" rel="prettyphoto[28859]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/before.png?resize=341%2C694" alt="before" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28869" /></a></p>
<p>With My Sites Search installed, you&#8217;ll have a search bar added to the top of the &#8220;My Sites&#8221; dropdown, allowing you to quickly navigate to any of your sites on the network.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/after.png" rel="prettyphoto[28859]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/after.png?resize=398%2C433" alt="after" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28868" /></a></p>
<p>As soon as I saw the plugin, I had to test it, having come up against this problem many times. It works exactly as advertised. My Sites Search is especially useful on closed networks where the super admin user has set up all of the sites. This normally results in a long &#8220;My Sites&#8221; list, as opposed to networks with open registration where users generally only register one site apiece.</p>
<p>Small enhancements like this can help to make your super admin life easier. If your &#8220;My Sites&#8221; dropdown is getting out of control, download the <a href="https://github.com/trepmal/my-sites-search" target="_blank">My Sites Search</a> plugin from GiHub.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 08:01:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>VaultPress has <a title="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2014/08/18/how-vaultpress-works/" href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2014/08/18/how-vaultpress-works/">announced</a> that a recent update to their backup systems have reduced the time required to build restore files by anywhere from 25%-90%. Before the change, VaultPress stored each SQL row in a separate file in its replicated file system which slowed down restore times.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before the VaultPress update, we were storing each SQL row in a separate file in our replicated filesystem. That slowed our restore times, because each table had to be regenerated from potentially millions¬†of individual files.</p>
<p>Now we store table dumps¬†and changes, building a restore typically involves far fewer¬†files per table.</p></blockquote>
<p>To go along with the decrease in restore times, the post also explains how the service works. If you&#8217;d like to try out VaultPress for free, consider using their <a title="http://wptavern.com/vaultpress-begins-offering-5-day-free-trials-through-jetpack" href="http://wptavern.com/vaultpress-begins-offering-5-day-free-trials-through-jetpack">five day trial period</a> through Jetpack.
