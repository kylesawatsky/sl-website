We make every reasonable effort to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.

Only authorized employees and suppliers have access to your personal information.

We keep your information for the time we are providing you with a product or service, and for a reasonable time thereafter in the event that you wish to resume service.

We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Credit card information is processed using industry-standard encryption and security. We do not collect personal information from bulletin boards or forums. However, we cannot guarantee that personal information voluntarily disclosed in chat rooms or discussion boards will not be collected and used by others, which may result in unsolicited messages to you from other parties.

<strong>9. Privacy and our websites</strong>

Tsunami sometimes collects personal information through its various websites. In this section, we provide you with additional information regarding such collection.

<strong>Cookies</strong>¬†- When an individual visitor accesses the Tsunami websites, we may use a browser feature called a ‚Äúcookie‚Äù to collect information such as the type of Internet browser and operating system the visitor uses, the domain name of the websites from which the visitor came, date and duration of the visit, number of visits, average time spent on our websites, pages viewed and number of cookies accumulated. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies the visitor‚Äôs browser, but not necessarily the visitor, to our computers each time our websites are visited. Unless a visitor specifically informs us (e.g. by enrolling for our services or sending us correspondence from the websites), we will not know who the individual visitors are. In addition to the identified purposes described in our Privacy Policy, we may use this website information and share it with other organizations with whom we have a commercial relationship to measure the use of our websites and to improve the functionality and content of the websites. Visitors can reset their browsers either to notify them when they have received a cookie or refuse to accept cookies. However, if a visitor refuses to accept cookies, he or she may not be able to use some of the features available on our websites.

<strong>Online Communications</strong>¬†- In order to provide our website visitors with a product, service or information, visitors may voluntarily submit personal information to us for purposes such as asking a question, obtaining information, subscribing to, reviewing or downloading a publication, participating in contests and surveys. If you are known to Tsunami as a registered user of an online service, we may combine and store personal information about your use of our websites and the online information you have provided with certain other online and offline information we may have collected.

<strong>E-Mail Communications¬†</strong>- Occasionally, we may send marketing or promotional e-mail communications to you with information that may be useful, including information about the products and services of Tsunami and other third parties with whom we have a relationship. We will include instructions on how to inform us of preferences if recipients decide they do not want to receive any future marketing or promotional e-mails from Tsunami.

Also, if you send us an email message, we may retain that message and your email address, as well as any response we send you.

<strong>Searches</strong>¬†- For your convenience, search functions are sometimes provided on our websites. We keep logs of the words searched to learn more about what kind of information our visitors are seeking, and thus improve our services.

<strong>Hyperlinks</strong>¬†- For your convenience, Tsunami‚Äôs websites sometimes contain hyperlinks to websites managed by third parties. By activating these hyperlinks, you will leave Tsunami‚Äôs websites for those of the third parties, which may have different privacy policies and practices than Tsunami. Tsunami cannot be held liable for the use of such third party websites.

<strong>Advertising to Children</strong>¬†- We believe that none of Tsunami‚Äôs websites appeal directly to children of 13 years old or less. We do not knowingly direct our advertising at children under the age of 13, except as permitted by law.

<strong>Individuals Under 18¬†</strong>- No personal information should be submitted or posted on our websites by individuals under 18 years of age without their parent‚Äôs or guardian‚Äôs permission. We may request name, address, phone number, email address and date of birth from an individual under 18 years of age for contest participation so that we may notify him or her if selected as a winner. In the event we do so, we will request their parent‚Äôs or guardian‚Äôs consent prior to collection.

No information collected from online guests under 18 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever by Tsunami. Unless otherwise disclosed at collection, we do not provide any personal information collected through any Tsunami website from individuals under 18 years old, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.

<strong>10. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>

Tsunami reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy, we will post such change on our websites and make such revised policy and change available upon request to the Tsunami Chief Privacy Officer. However, Tsunami will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable Privacy Laws if it seeks to collect, use or disclose an individual‚Äôs personal information for purposes other than those to which consent is obtained unless otherwise required or permitted by law.

Prior to January 1, 2004 some Tsunami websites may have collected personal information, such as e-mail address, using privacy policies which differ from the statement above. In such cases where information has already been provided, customers will be contacted and informed of the new policy practices before any new use is made of their personal information.

<strong>Appendix 1</strong>

What are ‚Äúfair information practices‚Äù?

In Canada, ‚Äúfair information practices‚Äù with regards to your personal information are reflected in a series of principles developed by the Canadian Standards Association and incorporated into Canadian privacy legislation, designed to ensure that companies treat your personal information fairly, protect its confidentiality and provide the means by which individuals can maintain a reasonable level of control over how their personal information is collected, used and disclosed. Tsunami collects, uses and discloses your personal information by employing ‚Äúfair information practices‚Äù as described in the following ten privacy principles:

</strong>
Tsunami is responsible for personal information under its control and has designated a Chief Privacy Officer who is accountable for Tsunami‚Äôs compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Laws. Contact information for the Chief Privacy Officer is provided in the¬†Contact Ussection of this Privacy Policy. In addition, our accountability for the personal information we collect continues even if we disclose it to other organizations. For example, whenever we disclose your information to another organization (such as to one of our service providers), we will put in place contractual and other safeguards to help ensure that they appropriately protect your personal information.

<strong>Principle 2 ‚Äì Identifying the Purposes for Collection of Personal Information
</strong>
Tsunami will identify the purposes for which your personal information is collected at or before the time the personal information is collected. Some of the identified purposes for which Tsunami typically collects, uses and discloses personal information are described in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy. If we intend to collect, use or disclose your personal information for additional purposes, we will either revise this Privacy Policy (and provide you with notice) or seek your consent.

<strong>Principle 3 ‚Äì Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information¬†</strong>

We will obtain your informed consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information, except as permitted by law. For example, we ask that you provide us with your consent to collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes described in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw consent at any time to some or all of the purposes indicated, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Please note, however, that in some circumstances, we may not be able to provide you with our services if you withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information.

<strong>Principle 4 ‚Äì Limiting Collection of Personal Information</strong>

Tsunami will limit the collection of personal information, both the amount and the type of information, to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by Tsunami. In addition, Tsunami will collect your personal information by fair and lawful means, and not by misleading or deceiving you about the purpose for which information is being collected.

<strong>Principle 5 ‚Äì Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention of Personal Information</strong>

Tsunami will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than the identified purposes for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law. Tsunami will retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfil the identified purposes.

Tsunami will endeavour to ensure that your personal information will be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. Tsunami will update personal information as and when necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or upon notification from the subject individual.
